# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Your curated memories. The distilled essence, not raw logs.*

## How This Works
- Daily files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) capture raw events (on-demand via tools)
- This file captures what's WORTH KEEPING long-term
- This file is auto-injected into your system prompt each session
- Keep it concise — every character here costs tokens

## Security
- ONLY loaded in main session (direct chat with your human)
- NEVER loaded in group chats or shared contexts
