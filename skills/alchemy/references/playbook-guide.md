# Community Alchemy — Facilitation Guide

Detailed questions and context for every section of the playbook, following the guide exactly.
Read this before beginning a session. Refer back to it section by section as you work through each area.

---

## Area 0 — Where Are You on Your Journey?

*Set the scene. Understand the starting point before anything else.*

**Permanence**
- "Do you imagine a **permanent** community — people making this their long-term home — or a **temporary/experiential** one where visitors come and go? Or a mix of both?"
  > *Context: Both models are valid and important to the regenerative movement. Permanent neighborhoods build deep roots; experiential ones spread the values widely.*

**Current Status**
- "Where are you on the journey right now?" *(offer options)*
  - Just an idea, no land yet
  - Have an idea and land, but no construction
  - Under construction, not yet open to members
  - Under construction and open for members
  - Fully established and operating

**Base Info**
- "What is the name of your community — or a working name if it's not finalised yet?"
- "What country, region, and general area are you thinking of?"
- "How much land do you have or are looking for? *(acres or hectares — or 'I don't know yet' is fine)*"

**Key Milestones**
- "What are the key dates so far — when did you start planning? Have you acquired land? Started building? Had first residents?"

---

## Area 1 — Hone Your Vision

*This is the foundation everything else rests on. Clarity here unlocks everything downstream.*

### 1.1 Pre-Foundation Work

**Where We Are Now**
- "Where are you on your community journey right now?"
- "How did you get here?"

**Dream Origin**
- "What brought you to the idea of making this community?"
- "How did you find this path?"
- "What was your 'aha' moment?"

**The Ethos: Values**
- "What are the core values you want your community to uphold?"
  > *Cue: As community builder Diana Leafe Christian puts it, 'a community's ideals usually arise from something that its members see as lacking or missing from the wider culture.' What is missing for you?*

### 1.2 Purpose, Mission, Vision

**Your BIG Why (Purpose)**
- "What is the deep reason you want to create this community? What problem are you trying to solve — for yourself, for others, for the planet?"

**Mission Statement**
- "How will your community accomplish its purpose? In 1–4 sentences: what will happen when your community is working together and achieving its goals?"
  > *Context: A mission statement acts like a compass — it guides your core team in decisions and communicates who you are to potential members, investors, and visitors.*
  > *Examples to spark thinking:*
  > *- "Cosmic Sol's ongoing mission is to grow food using regenerative and self-sufficient methods for the good of the planet and for the good of the people."*
  > *- "We are an egalitarian, child-centered community that welcomes human diversity, ecological sensibility, mutual learning, and joy."*

**Vision**
- "Picture your community at its absolute peak success. Describe what you see. Walk me through it."
  > *Cue: Be specific and vivid — what does it look like, feel like, smell like? What are people doing? Who's there? For example: 'I walk through a food forest and people are picking fresh vegetables...'*
- "Who benefits from your community, and how are they transformed by being there?"
- "What role does your community play in a better future world?"

**Vision Document: Timeline Goals**
- "What do you want to have achieved in 1 year? 3 years? 5 years? 10 years?"

**Initial Goals (1–3 years)**
- "What are 3 goals for your first three years? Why is each important?"

**Mid-Term Goals (5 years)**
- "What are your goals for year 5? What's the overall community impact you aim to have?"

**Long-Term Goals (10 years)**
- "Looking out 10 years — what does full success look like?"

### 1.3 Foundational Community Design

**Community Type**
- "What type of community are you building?" *(offer to list options)*
  > *Types include: Residential/Family-Focused, Digital Nomad, Farm/Permaculture Centre, Wellness/Retreat, Spiritual, Artist/Maker's Collective, Innovation & Education, Homesteading/Traditional Living, Plant Medicine, Indigenous/Ethnicity-Based, Lifestyle (diet/waste reduction), Conservation Project, Caravan/Temporary. It can be multiple types.*

**Location/Setting**
- "What climate are you drawn to? What location or potential locations?"
- "Urban, suburban, or rural?"

**Community Size**
- "How many people do you envision? Give me a range."
  > *Context: The playbook recommends starting with a founding group of 7–12 people. Communities of 30 adults or fewer tend to have the best early success. Dunbar's Number (~150 people) is often cited as the upper limit for intimate community. Beyond that, you're creating a village or micro-city.*
  - Village Scale: 20–200 people
  - Micro-City Scale: 200–1,500
  - City Scale: 1,500+

**Counterpart Analysis**
- "Are there existing communities in the world that inspire you? What do you love about them? What would you do differently?"

### 1.4 Vision

**Naming**
- "Does your community have a name? If not, what words, feelings, or concepts capture its essence?"

**Visioning Exercises** *(offer these as optional tools)*
- Mood board (e.g. on Pinterest — examples: Regen Tribe's Kuyabeh, ecovillage boards, solarpunk aesthetics)
- Vision document (e.g. Cabin.city's Vision Document)
- Pitch deck (Re:build Deck Template)
- Drawing your village
- AI-generated concept art

**Community Culture Canvas**
- "Have you mapped your community culture yet? The Community Culture Canvas is a visual manifesto — a great exercise to do with co-founders."

### 1.5 Additional Tools

- "Are there courses, books, manifestos, or communities that are shaping your thinking? What inspires you?"
  > *Offer examples if useful: Regenaissance Playbook, OASA's Regenerative Development Standards, Dragon Dreaming, The Village Model.*

- "Which of these do you already have covered? Which are gaps?"

### 2.5 Value Exchange / The Harmony Principle

*Every member must add value and feel valued.*

- "What does each type of member contribute — time, money, skills, land, other?"
- "What do they receive in return?"
  > *By member type:*
  > *- Co-founder: ownership, equity, profit, special benefits*
  > *- Community member: ownership, access to amenities, special benefits*
  > *- Short-term member: experiences, education, standard of living*
  > *- Investor: ROI, equity, timely payback*

### 2.6 The Recruitment Journey

**Requirements**
- "What must potential members bring on their own — behaviours, lifestyle choices, dietary requirements, commitments, fees, hours of participation?"

**Screening Process**
- "How will someone move from curious stranger to committed member? What are the steps?"
  > *Example steps: Share vision → Requirements list → Gauge interest → Casual meeting → Intentional meeting → Explore commitment → Application → Reference checks → Trial period → Community feedback → Decision*

**Onboarding Process**
- "How does someone start their journey into your community? Is there a formal review process?"
- "How will you bring in diversity while maintaining alignment with your core values?"

**Offboarding Process**
- "What rights does the community have over members who don't keep their side of agreements?"
- "How will you handle departure due to conflict, old age, death, financial difficulty, or simply wanting to leave?"

- "What type of relationship do you want with the land you steward? What does 'right relationship with land' mean to you in practice?"

### 5.2 Main Considerations

**Size & Density**
- "How much land do you need?" *(walk through the calculation)*
  > *Guide framework: (size of individual lots × number of households) + shared area size + food growing area (vegetarian: 1.5 hectares/person; with meat: 2.5 hectares/person) + water systems (5–10 m² per person) + business use + conservation areas.*
  > *Density options: low (0.5–5 residents/acre), mid (5–12), compact (12+), high (20+)*
- "How dense do you want the living spaces to feel?"

**Land Features**
- "What are your non-negotiables?" *(walk through)*
  - Location specifics
  - Landscape features (topography, forest, water, etc.)
  - Existing structures and infrastructure
  - Level of isolation vs. community connectivity
  - Nearby facilities and essential services
  - Access roads and distance to town/city/airport
  - Possibility for expansion
  - Terrain accessibility and suitability for agriculture
  > *Tip: The guide suggests favouring existing properties over virgin land — less ecological disruption, often faster to develop.*

**Ecological Data**
- "What ecological features are you assessing or seeking?" *(walk through)*
  - Land elevation and topography
  - Wind direction and patterns
  - Climate (number of seasons, rainfall, extremes)
  - Existing flora, fauna, fungi
  - Water sources (rivers, wells, rainfall)
  - Soil composition and quality
  - Sun exposure and solar potential

**Economic**
- "What economic opportunities exist locally — job markets, supply chains, currency strength?"

### 5.4 How to Look for Land

- "What search methods are you using — agents, direct outreach, community land networks, online listings?"
  > *Tip from the guide: The best deals happen off-market. Build relationships with landowners directly.*
- "Are you open to land that needs significant ecological restoration work?"

### 5.5 How to Buy or Acquire Land

- "What is your acquisition model?"
  - Private ownership (transitioning to collective over time)
  - Collective ownership from the start (fractional, cooperative, community land trust, 99-year use contracts, DAO)

### 6.1 Simplified Process

- "What is the total capital needed to reach Phase 1 operational?"
- "How much do you have or have committed right now?"
- "What is the gap — and over what timeframe do you need to close it?"
  > *Framework: Cost excavation → Open channels of capital → Stewardship incentives → Community culture = community capital.*

### 6.2 In-Depth Process

**Find the Cost to Build**
- "Let's estimate your build cost. Walk me through: land cost + each structure/infrastructure item and rough price quotes."
  > *Guide reference pricing:*
  > *- US: ~$153/sq ft medium finish*
  > *- UK: £2,133–£3,764/sq m*
  > *- Mexico: $500–$900/sq m medium finish*
  > *- Roads: gravel $1.50/sq ft; asphalt $7–$13/sq ft*
  > *- Gardens: ~$3/sq m for a 2-hectare food forest*
  > *- Expert tip: Land cost should be ~20% of total development if selling lots, ~10% if building houses.*

## Area 9 — Build Your Neighborhoods

*How you build shapes how people live. The built environment encodes your values.*

### 9.1 Bioharmonic Principles

- "What is your philosophy for how construction relates to the land — not dominating it, but coexisting with it?"

### 9.2 Cycles of Design and Building

> *Guide framework: The 5-step cycle mirroring nature:*
> *1. Observe — document what's already on site to reuse*
> *2. Plan — next cycle, needed materials/skills*
> *3. Design — apply site planning principles, remain flexible for phased implementation*
> *4. Build — eyes open for opportunities*
> *5. Iterate — reflect and return to step 1*

- "Where are you in this cycle right now?"
- "What are the neighbourhood phases you're aiming for?" *(idea → land → construction → developing → minimum viable → operating → fully established → regenerative)*

### 9.3 Spatial Design

- "How will your spaces be designed for interaction, learning, growth, and wellbeing?"
- "How will buildings be clustered — what's the relationship between private and shared space?"

### 9.4 Choosing Methods of Building

- "What building methods are you drawn to?" *(offer context on each)*
  - **Traditional construction** — brick, wood, concrete, steel. Proven durability.
  - **Adobe** — sun-dried earth/clay/sand/straw bricks. Excellent thermal mass.
  - **SuperAdobe** — earthbag construction. Earthquake-resistant. Adaptable.
  - **Bamboo** — high strength-to-weight ratio. Popular in tropics. (e.g. Green School, Bali)
  - **Straw-bale** — excellent thermal and acoustic insulation with clay/lime renders.
  - **Earthships** — passive solar homes from tires, cans, bottles. Off-grid capable. (e.g. Greater World Earthship Community, Taos NM)
  - **Rammed earth** — compacted earth in formwork. Dense, sturdy thermal mass. (e.g. Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre, Canada)
  - **Hempcrete** — resource: hanfstein.eu
  - **Prefab/modular** — speed and expandability.
  - **Yurt kits** — 12' ~$9,480 to 30' ~$21,320 (shelterdesigns.net)
  - **Dome kits** — metal tube dome systems with known pricing.
  - **Organic architecture** — curves and forms aligned with nature.
- "What local materials, skills, and tradespeople are available to you?"

### 9.5 What to Build First

- "What do you build first — the infrastructure that enables everything else?"
  > *Guide recommends: sustainable infrastructure (water, energy, waste) first → then housing support → then living space. Early options: tents, domes, simple cabanas (~$10,000 incl. plumbing), private homes, coliving spaces, guest spaces.*
- "How will early builders and founders be housed during construction?"

### 9.6 Architectural Design & Plans

- "Do you have an architect or designer? Who?"
- "How will the design process work — specialist-led or community-participatory?"

### 9.7 Service Providers

- "What contractors, engineers, and specialists will you need?"
  > *What you can learn: power tools, electrical, plumbing, glass, greywater systems.*
  > *What to outsource: blackwater treatment, foundations, concrete formwork.*
- "How will you find and vet service providers?"

### 9.8 Sourcing Materials

- "How will you source materials — locally, reclaimed, donated, new imports?"
- "What are your standards for material quality and ecological sourcing?"

### 9.9 Incorporating Local Wisdom

- "Who are the local builders, traditional craftspeople, and knowledge holders in your area?"
- "How will you genuinely incorporate their wisdom and invite them into the process?"

### 9.10 Creative Ways to Build

- "Are you interested in any creative building models?"
  - **Community builds** — host events where you share abundance (food, experience) for people's time. Good for simple tasks.
  - **Academy models** — teach skills while building. Requires a competent teaching team.
  - **Barn raising / earthship academies / dome workshops** — modular, expandable, community-bonding.
- "What building projects do you plan to initiate in your first 12 months?"
- "What is the very first build, and who leads it?"
